Mission 0 - Create quick page as a template for a new digital news home page for Marketing Associatin NZ. 

This project was created using React.

App.js splits the User Interface into 3 main react function components: header.jsx, SearchSection.jsx, and CardSection.jsx. 

CardSection.jsx also imports another react component called Card.jsx which creates the structure of the different cards in the Card Section. 

Flexbox, available in CSS, was used for the layout of the webpage. 

Media queries were used to ensure compability with mobile or smaller screens. The media queries change the layout of the page and implements a hamburger icon to display a drop down menu when clicked instead.
